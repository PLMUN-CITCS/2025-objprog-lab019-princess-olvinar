Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer.
Read the user's input from the console.
Validate the input to ensure it is a non-negative integer. If the input is invalid, provide an error message and prompt the user again (consider using a loop for this).
Return the validated non-negative integer.
Take a non-negative integer n as a parameter.
Handle the base case: if n is 0, return 1 (factorial of 0 is 1).
For n greater than 0, use a loop (e.g., for loop) to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive) and calculate the factorial.
Return the calculated factorial.
